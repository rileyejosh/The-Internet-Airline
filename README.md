## I. Overview

The DB-PNW, Inc. proposes creating a new Internet airline reservation website called *The Internet Airline*. The purpose of our website is to create a convenient and easy-to-use system for buying airline tickets at affordable prices.

We will have a large database supporting dozens of major cities around the world as well as hundreds of flights. Above all, we hope to provide a comfortable user experience along with the best pricing available on the internet.

In addition, we plan to utilize modern internet technologies such as JDBC, cookies, and servlets in our project.

**Update**: *The Internet Airline is being remodeled using the MVC architecture*
